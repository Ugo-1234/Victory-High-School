Or simply open the repository's index.html in your browser.

## Tech stack

## Project structure (example)
- index.html — main landing page
- about.html — about the school
- admissions.html — admissions information
- programs.html — academic and extracurricular programs
- events.html — upcoming events and calendar
- contact.html — contact form and details (static/demo)
- assets/
  - css/ — stylesheets
  - js/ — JavaScript files
  - images/ — images and logos

Adjust the structure above to match the repository's actual layout.

## Development
- Coding conventions:
  - HTML: semantic markup and accessible elements
  - CSS: modular, use BEM-like naming if preferred; keep variables in a root file
  - JavaScript: keep behavior unobtrusive; ES6+ syntax is fine
- Testing:
  - Test responsiveness using device emulator or browser resize
  - Validate HTML/CSS with validators if desired

## Known limitations
